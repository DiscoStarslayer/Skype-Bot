Skype's group chat feature allows for a persistant chat room through p2p. Me and my friends 
ran into a problem like this:

A B and C online
D offline

A B and C have conversation then go offline

D goes online and sees no conversation as A B or C aren't avalible to update the chat for D

I have a headless linux server (old laptop with a broken screen). I decided to use it to add a E to the chat
that says online constantly so that A to D will have the most up-to-date chat at all times.

Just having it sit there is no fun though, using the Skype API, DBUS and python I am working on extra
functionality to this E.

WIP

Current goals:

Encapsulate Skype API and DBUS to simplify parsing chat messages and sending responses

implement !fortune which responds with a randomly generated fortune made with the fortune application
