Skype's group chat feature alows for a persistant chat room through p2p. Me and my friends ran into a problem like this:

A B and C online
D offline

A B and C have conversation then go offline

D goes online and sees no conversation as A B or C aren't avalible to update the chat for D

I have a headless linux server (old laptop with a broken screen). I decided to use it to add a E to the chat that stays online constantly. That way A B C and D will have the most up-to-date chat at all times.

Just having it sit there is no fun though, using the Skype API, DBUS and python I am working on adding extra functionality to this E.


WIP

Current goals:

- Encapsulate Skype API and DBUS to simplify parsing chat messages and sending responses

- Implement !fortune which responds with a randomly generated fortune made with the fortune application

Requirements:
xvfb
skype
python2.7.X
dbus
python2-gobject2
fortune-mod

Tested on: Ubuntu Server 12.04 64bit
